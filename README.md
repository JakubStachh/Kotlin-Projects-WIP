# 📦 La Installation

### 𓀃 The Actual Installation🤌🤌

#### You can use [Programiz Complier](https://www.programiz.com/golang/online-compiler/) or similar online compliers to run the code

#### But if you're using e.g. Windows Powershell you should:

- Make sure you have GO installed. You can install it using [GO](https://go.dev/doc/install):

  ```sh
  go version
  ```
  
- [Download](https://github.com/JakubStachh/GO-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the code
- Unpack the zip file
- Find the `GO-Projects-main\GO Projects\`
- Open the folder of the program You want to try out `GO-Projects-main\GO Projects\Anagram Check`
- and then run:
  
  ```sh
  go run AnagramCheck.go
  ```
#### Should work in `Visual Studio Code` if yours *had been already set up for Golang*

1. And Voilà! You've done it! You've actually checked my code! 
2. Thank You. All I'm hoping for is... that I hadn't make any mistakes.
3. Well... maybe... rather: that they're not THAT serious.....
4. If there are any: I'm sorry, and I will update it when the right time comes.... 
5. But for now... let's enjoy this peacful while with - beloved by many - EL SNOOPY!!!
